# What is Senzing?

Senzing is the first real-time AI for entity resolution.

Entity Resolution (ER) is the process that determines who is who and who is related to who within and across your data. Entity Resolution differs from simple record matching; Entity Resolution creates a complete résumé of an entity including all the names you know them by, all the places they have lived that you have recorded, the email addresses they have used, etc. Senzing also figures out, and remembers how resolved entities are related.

Organizations can get started immediately using the Senzing desktop application for end users, and scale up by embedding the Senzing technology into your new or existing systems using our APIs.

Senzing is free up to 10k records for both the API and desktop app. For more information about pricing, see our [pricing page](https://senzing.com/pricing/senzing/).

The process of using Senzing is similar across all use cases, and involves the following steps:
1. Locate your Data Source
2. Load your Data
3. Review your Matches
4. Single Subject Searches
5. Export Entity Resolution Outcomes

As you work through the examples, you'll see an example of how to do all of these things with a set of sample data.
