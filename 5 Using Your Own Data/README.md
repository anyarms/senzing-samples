# Using your own data
The Senzing App is specifically designed to support people and organizations. For ER to be effective, these entities will have names, addresses, phone numbers, identifiers and other attributes. WARNING: If you have name only data or names plus very limited information e.g. city or gender, Senzing is not for you.

Senzing is perfectly suited to entity resolve your customers, prospects, employees and vendors. Really any data source containing identity data, including watch lists.
